== About Nemo

Nemo aims to be a complete backup solution for POSIX systems (Mac OS X, Linux, BSD, etc.).
It is still in the very early stages of development, but it will eventually provide:

* Hourly & daily incremental backups
* Compressed full backups at user-specified intervals
* A command line interface
* A web interface to manage snapshots, restore files, and browse through the compressed full backups.

This is my first attempt at creating an application, and consequently it's pretty messy as I'm still getting a feel for it. 
It's written in pure Ruby, with YAML for the configuration files.

Nemo rose from the need for a backup solution at my workplace. I began adapting some shell scripts that I found online, but
I realized that I could save time and keep my code more (human-)readable if I did everything in Ruby instead. One script turned into
three and soon I realized I needed a superclass or module or configuration file to keep everyone playing nicely with each other.
Thus Nemo was born... It doesn't get its name not from Jules Verne, the file server in my office just happens to be named Nemo...

== About The Author

I'm a 22 year old college student majoring in scientific programming (which turns out to be lots of Java that has nothing to do with
science...). Ruby is the first language that really gave me a basic understanding of programming. 
It was easy enough that I could do useful little things with it very early on, and it's been the language I've kept coming back
to whenever I need to get something done quickly and with little mess.
